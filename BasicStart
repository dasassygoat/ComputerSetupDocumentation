Getting Started:

http://getbootstrap.com/ - Great Starting Point, especially if you are not a designer.
http://modernizr.com/ - Must Have, resets various browsers and provides a good place to start creating own css rules
http://jquery.com/ - Sort of Self Explanitory, great javascript framework

Tools:

http://sass-lang.com/ - I have really only began to touch the full power of Sass but I am excited by the nesting and 
the variables especially.

Platforms:

to support it.

Editors:

are the watches that you can set up on files like scss, as well as Git integration.
