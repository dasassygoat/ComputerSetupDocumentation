Computer Setup Documentation
=========

This repository houses a couple of list of links for software and website. However, currently the main focus is to record my Windows application setup. I want to try to not install applications if I'm going to later want to remove them. The New Windows Setup file will record the software that stands the test of time on my current system. In the event that I need to start with new hardware I don't have to go through the process of trial and error.

Additional document has been created to to record my testing of a file structuring that is pleasant to look at and meets all of the requirments that I have for it. This has so far been elusive.
