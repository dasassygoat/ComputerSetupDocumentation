Computer Setup Documentation
=========

This repository houses a couple of lists of links for software and websites. However, currently the main focus is to record my computer setup documentation. I don't want to install applications if I'm going to later want to remove them. Uninstalling applications almost always is messy. The documents will record the software that I have installed as it stands the test of time. When I need to start with new hardware I don't have to go through the process of trial and error with the applications that are installed.

Additional documents have been created to record a testing of a file structure that is pleasant to look at and meets all of the requirments that I have. This has so far been elusive.
